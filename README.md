## Overview
This project aims to visualize malaria data in Rwanda since 2002 using PowerBI. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore and understand the trends, patterns, and factors contributing to malaria incidence in the country. **Note: The data presented in this project is generated and does not represent real-world data.**

## Project Phases

### 1. Requirements and Variables Collection
- **Objective:** Identify the key variables and requirements for the visualization.
- **Method:** Conducted a literature review to determine the most relevant malaria data for visualization.

### 2. UI Design with Figma
- **Objective:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the dashboard.
- **Method:** Utilized Figma to create wireframes and prototypes, incorporating feedback from potential users.

### 3. Data Schema Design
- **Objective:** Organize data in a structured manner for efficient visualization.
- **Method:** Designed a normalized data schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

### 4. Dashboard Development
- **Objective:** Develop the dashboard according to the design and data schema.
- **Method:** Implemented the dashboard in PowerBI, focusing on performance optimization and user experience.

## Data and Methodology

### Data Generation
- **Population Data:** The population numbers for 2002, 2012, and 2022 were obtained from NISR data. The rate of increase was found  to be 2.16 percent.
- **Case Distribution:** The number of cases for each species of malaria and other variables (e.g., death rates) were randomly distributed across different districts of Rwanda for each year between 2002 and 2023.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Tools:** PowerBI for data visualization.
- **Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the generated data.
- **Visualizations:** Created interactive charts, maps, and dashboards to visualize the data.
